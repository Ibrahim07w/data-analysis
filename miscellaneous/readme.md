# üìÇ Miscellaneous Projects

This folder contains a variety of standalone and exploratory data analysis projects that do not belong to a specific structured collection. It also includes implementations inspired by tutorials, courses, blogs, and experiments with public datasets.

## üìå Purpose

The contents of this folder serve multiple purposes:

- Prototypes and early versions of data projects
- Hands-on exercises from tutorials and workshops
- Exploratory analysis of public or synthetic datasets
- Test cases for trying out new techniques or tools
- Code snippets and ideas that might later be integrated into larger projects

## üß† Topics Covered

While not organized by theme, this folder includes work related to:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- Visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.
- Statistical testing and modeling
- Time series experiments
- Small machine learning prototypes
- Tutorial follow-alongs (Kaggle, YouTube, Coursera, etc.)

## üìÅ Structure

Each subfolder or notebook may include:

- A `README.md` with a short description of the task or dataset
- `.ipynb` or `.py` scripts for analysis
- Relevant datasets or links to external sources
- Visualizations or exported result files

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

You may find usage of:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- SQL (for queries and integration with data sources)
- Excel/CSV/JSON file processing
- Power BI / Tableau (in some exported files or screenshots)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

These projects are **not guaranteed to be production-ready**, and may contain partial code, uncleaned outputs, or comments from live sessions and experimentation. The goal is learning, iteration, and ideation.
